      <h2>Photoshop Unit</h2>
      <p>The first unit! Learning how to use Photoshop was the very thing that prompted me to take Digital Media. Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It is particularly known for its extensive arsenal of image-editing tools and extensions. This unit played an important role in teaching the basics and preparing me for later software, particularly Illustrator and InDesign.</p>

      <p class="caption">One of the first Photoshop tutorial projects. Taught the basics of image layers and effects.</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/glasstext.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">An open-ended text tutorial assignment. I couldn't think of anything for the title.</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/melonheads.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">The second Photoshop project. The melon head on the left is the one we were required to recreate, but the one on the right is my own handiwork!</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/poses.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">This was a very unique assignment from the Design sub-unit. If I remember correctly, we were supposed to find two fonts and try to match the emotions they gave off.</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/differences.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">The idea was to create one of those puzzles where you're supposed to find the differences between two images. The image in question is actually a screenshot from the dungeon-crawler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">Rogue</a>.</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/redesign.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">I recreated a professional magazine cover and swapped the guy on the cover with a cutout of some girl. I don't remember why the title looks so distorted.</p>
      <img src="./photoshop/magcovers.jpg" />
      <p class="caption">I'm quite proud of how these turned out. I probably could've put a bit more care into the font choices, but other than that they aren't too shabby.</p>
