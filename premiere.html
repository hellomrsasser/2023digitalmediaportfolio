      <h2>Premiere Unit</h2>
      <p>Adobe Premiere is a timeline-based video editing software. Users assemble videos by drag-and-dropping audio and/or visual clips, and can also employ a massive library of special effects and adjustments to their heart's content. It's the go-to resource for those looking to produce short films or videos, particularly content creators. Notably, Premiere was used extensively in the production of the 2016 blockbuster Deadpool. In this rather interesting unit, I learned how to make short videos from nothing more than a folder of resources.</p>

      <p class="caption">An introductory project. Includes some of my favorite things, from video games to text editors. In Premiere, digital assets are lined up on a series of tracks, and it's important to make sure that media on different tracks line up properly to produce the desired effect. This is why many of the unit's tutorial assignments involved timing.</p>

      <p class="caption">A brief documentary on the absolutely riveting history of the banana republics. Intended to be a sequel to our George Washington practice documentary. I wrote a teleprompt script so that my dad wouldn't have to scroll through the document while he read.</p>

      <p class="caption">A demonstration of keyframes and ultrakey (the function by which green screen is processed in Premiere). If you recognize the background, it's the Personal Collage from the Photoshop unit, which you can check out on the home page. Have you ever seen Revenge of the Sith?</p>

      <p class="caption">It would be a crime not to include the music video recreate project. This one combined just about everything taught in the unit. Transitions, animations, ultrakey, timing, etc. It's stupid song has also been stuck in the middle of my head every since I completed the project <i>a few months ago</i>. When you're editing in Premiere, you have to replay the same section over and over again until you get it right. I've probably heard every single second at least a few dozen times. I <i>dreamed</i> this music video.</p>
