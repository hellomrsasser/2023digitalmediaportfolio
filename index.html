      <p>When I wrote the number for Digital Media in my course request form, it was my expectation that a meager experience of Photoshop was all that I could hope to gain from the class. You can imagine my pleasant suprise when I discovered that there is far more to Digital Media than using Adobe products. Throughout the school year, I have come to understand SCRAP, the basic design principles. I have learned to both analyze and truly appreciate commercial design. In our Illustrator unit, for instance, I witnessed firsthand many of the styles and techniques at work in popular corporate logos and promotional art. But the educational aspect was not what made it my favorite unit. Rather, I enjoyed the many open-ended assignments (among them Original Vehicle Scene, Business Logo, and Comic Strip) that allowed me to take a more creative approach.<br><br>But an eye for design was, while perhaps the most vital, certainly not the only thing I managed to glean from my time in Digital Media. I gained a fairly in-depth crash course on how to effectively use various Adobe software, including the ever-popular Photoshop and Premiere, and how to navigate the alien world of macOS. As all of these tools have practical applications in nearly every major industry, there is probably no shortage of career opportunities seeking individuals with such skills. Throughout history, there has always been a demand for those with the ability to influence public opinion through visual media. One must only look to the propaganda machines of most major civilizations, from the political maneuvering of the ancient Roman Senate to the premodern red utopia painted by the Soviets.</p>
