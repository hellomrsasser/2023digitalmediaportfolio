      <h2>Illustrator Unit</h2>
      <p>The third unit. Illustrator is a vector graphics editor. It can be used for creating beautiful, scalable designs, from logos to promotional art. Unlike the raster-based Photoshop, Illustrator deals exclusively in geometric vectors and shapes, making it a lot easier and more straightforward to use. Throughout this unit, I learned to create complex designs with Illustrator's wide selection of tools and effects. Illustrator's easiness, combined with the large amount of open-ended projects that it contained, made this unit my favorite.</p>

      <p class="caption">My custom business logo. The objective of the assignment was to create a logo that employed themes associated with a non-existent business of my choice. I went through many iterations before settling on the final design.</p>
      <img src="./illustrator/vehiclescene.png" />
      <p class="caption">In this assignment, we were supposed to create an original vehicle scene, with the vehicle, character, and background drawn entirely in Illustrator. I initially intended on doing the B-29 bomber plane, but it's kinda tough to draw detailed planes with nothing more than ovals and lines, so I went with a more rectangular vehicle: the killdozer. Even then, it took me <i>days</i> to make the treads look half-normal. The image I traced can be seen <a href="./illustrator/killdozer.jpg">here</a>.</p>

      <p class="caption">One of the unit's tutorial assignments. I recreated three designs: a pencil, a caterpillar, and a car. The last challenge was an old-timey television, with the catch that we had to find our own TV to recreate. The one I made incorporated features from various student examples, including the screen's gradient, the angled feet, and the speaker grill.</p>
      <img src="./illustrator/frosty.png" />
      <p class="caption">Frosty the Snowman! This was one of those projects were I just followed the instructional video. Notice how nearly the entire image was created from basic geometric shapes. I think the point was to show how far Illustrator's simple tools can take you.</p>
